# Privacy policy

*Houston, we have a bug* respects your privacy.

This Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to external servers.

## Data usage

The extension processes website content locally in the browser in order to:

- Capture screenshots of the active tab
- Allow users to annotate screenshots
- Collect basic system information (such as page URL, browser version, operating system, and display details) to support bug reporting

All data is processed locally and remains under the user’s control. Screenshots and system information are only created when the user explicitly activates the extension.

## Data sharing

The extension does not share, sell, or transmit user data to third parties. Any screenshots or information generated by the extension are exported or shared solely by the user.

## Accounts and tracking

The extension does not require user accounts and does not perform tracking, analytics, or background monitoring.

## Changes

If data usage changes in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
