# Privacy policy

*Houston, we have a bug* respects your privacy.

This Chrome extension does not transmit, share, or store user data on external servers.

## Data usage

The extension processes website content locally in the user’s browser in order to capture screenshots of the active tab, allow users to annotate screenshots, and collect basic system information needed for bug reporting. This system information may include the current page URL, date and time, browser version, operating system, and display details.

All data is processed locally and remains under the user’s control. Screenshots and system information are created only when the user explicitly activates the extension.

## Data sharing

The extension does not share, sell, or transmit user data to third parties. Any screenshots or information generated by the extension are exported or shared solely by the user through their own actions.

## Accounts and tracking

The extension does not require user accounts and does not perform tracking, analytics, background monitoring, or automated data collection.

## Changes

If data usage changes in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
