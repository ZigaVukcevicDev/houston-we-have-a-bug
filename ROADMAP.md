# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of **Houston, we have a bug**.
The focus is on keeping the tool **simple, fast, and genuinely useful for bug reporting**, without unnecessary complexity.

## Guiding principles

- **Speed over features** – capturing a bug should take seconds
- **Low cognitive load** – minimal UI, obvious tools
- **Practical QA workflows** – tools people actually use
- **Privacy-aware by default** – easy redaction of sensitive data

The goal is to cover **real-world bug reporting needs** with a small, reliable toolset.

### Core actions
