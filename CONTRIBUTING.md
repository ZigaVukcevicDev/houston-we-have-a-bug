# Contributing Guidelines

## Source of Truth

- **Never edit the `dist/` folder directly.**
- All changes must be made in the `src/` or other source folders. The `dist/` folder is generated by the build process and should always be overwritten by running the build.

## Workflow

- Make all edits to source files only.
- Run the build process (`npm run build`) to generate the latest output in `dist/`.
- Only commit changes from source files. Do not commit or manually edit files in `dist/`.

## Why?

- Editing `dist/` directly leads to inconsistencies and lost changes after a build.
- Keeping `dist/` as a pure build artifact ensures reproducibility and clean version control.

## Best Practices

- If you need to change the UI, logic, or markup, always update the corresponding file in `src/`.
- If you see a bug in a built file, trace it back to the source and fix it there.

Thank you for following these guidelines to keep the project clean and maintainable!
