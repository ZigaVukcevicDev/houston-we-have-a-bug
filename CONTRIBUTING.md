# Contributing Guidelines

## Clean Refactoring

When refactoring, renaming, or moving files, **always remove any leftovers** (unused code, duplicate styles, obsolete files, or outdated references). The codebase should never contain remnants from previous implementations or migrations.

This keeps the project clean, maintainable, and easy to understand for everyone.

## Source of Truth

**Never edit the `dist/` folder directly.**  
All changes must be made in the `src/` or other source folders. The `dist/` folder is generated by the build process and should always be overwritten by running the build.

---

## Workflow

1. **Edit source files only.**
2. **Build:** Run `npm run build` to generate the latest output in `dist/`.
3. **Commit:** Only commit changes from source files. Do **not** commit or manually edit files in `dist/`.
4. **Documentation:** Whenever you make a change to the codebase, check if the `README.md` needs to be updated to reflect your changes.

---

## Why?

- Editing `dist/` directly leads to inconsistencies and lost changes after a build.
- Keeping `dist/` as a pure build artifact ensures reproducibility and clean version control.

---

## Best Practices

- If you need to change the UI, logic, or markup, always update the corresponding file in `src/`.
- If you see a bug in a built file, trace it back to the source and fix it there.
