# Contributing

> ⚠️ Note: This project is still under active development and is not yet published.
> Please open an issue before starting work on larger changes or new features.

## Quick start

1. **Install**: `npm install`
2. **Develop**: `npm run dev` (Builds and watches for changes)
3. **Test**: `npm run test:all` (Runs unit and E2E tests)

## Guidelines

- **Source code**: Only edit files in `src/`. The `dist/` folder is auto-generated.
- **Testing**: All new features and bug fixes **must** have passing tests.
- **Test locally**: Run `npm run test:all` before committing.

## Submitting changes

1. Ensure `npm run test:all` passes.
2. Commit your changes (Husky will verify tests again).
3. Open a pull request.
